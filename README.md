###  Hello I m Zehra Nur ,

- I would like to share with you my graduation project that I prepared for the Data Science Academy.
- For this project, I wanted to choose a data set on heart disease, a subject I am interested in.
- To see a detailed tabular description of my dataset, please see the  Report.ipynb file
- To se  Data Set  of Heart-Disease  please see the the Data  folder.
- I have filed a file with its own name for each of the algorithms I use. You can review whatever you want.
- I wrote a summary report that contains information about heart disease and explains the Algorithm structures. Please visit the   Report.md  file to review.
- For all required libraries ---> Install Requirement.txt
