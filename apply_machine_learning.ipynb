    "The Classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning technique that is used to identify the category of new observations on the basis of training data. In Classification, a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies new observation into a number of classes or groups. Such as, Yes or No, 0 or 1, Spam or Not Spam, cat or dog, etc. Classes can be called as targets/labels or categories.\n",
    "Binary Classifier: If the classification problem has only two possible outcomes, then it is called as Binary Classifier.\n",
    "Examples: YES or NO, MALE or FEMALE, SPAM or NOT SPAM, CAT or DOG, etc."
